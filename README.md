## Run the Server:
- Use CMake to build your project.
- Run the generated test executable.
- Look for the message ===WAITING=== in the terminal.


## Connect to the Server:

- Open a web browser.
- Enter http://127.0.0.1:80 in the address bar.

## Check Connection:

- Go back to the terminal.
- If things are working, you'll see ===Connected and Sent===


Remember:

- This works on Unix-like systems (not Windows as necessary packages are unavailable).
- Port 80 should be available.
- Be mindful of security when dealing with network connections.
